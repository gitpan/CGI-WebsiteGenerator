These are some thoughts on what I need to do still.  Order does not indicate
priority.

* Write test scripts for everything.  Until then you just have to use them as
they were intended to see if they work.  In many cases, you could run the
"Synopsis" programs and compare their output to what I have in the POD.

* Write makefiles for everything.  Meanwhile, you'll have to copy the
old-fashioned way.

* Complete POD for all CGI::WPM::* modules; they are missing 
Description, and method lists or descriptions.  Until then, you'll just have to
look at the code or my Synopsis examples to know what to call, sorry.

* Add features to the various e-mail form modules to make them more customizable 
and to reflect pending updates in HTML::FormMaker.  For example, allow senders 
to be anonymous.

* Add a CGI::WPM::MultiPane module to implement multi-part HTML pages where each
part is made by an arbitrary other WPM module instance; for example, have a 
static html page and a mail form appear together; or, have a guest book 
submission form and previous signings appear together.  Before I do this, I 
need updates to Globals and its parent modules so that WPM modules called in 
parallel can't accidentally overwrite each other.

* Add a CGI::WPM::Password module to implement simple password protection for
some/all of a generated website.

* Add a CGI::WPM::MessageBoard module to implement a threaded discussion board.

* Perhaps make use of some DBI related stuff.
