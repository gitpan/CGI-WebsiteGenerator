These are some thoughts on what I need to do still.  Order does not indicate
priority.

* Write test scripts for everything.  Until then you just have to use them as
they were intended to see if they work.  In many cases, you could run the
"Synopsis" programs and compare their output to what I have in the POD.

* Write makefiles for everything.  Meanwhile, you'll have to copy the
old-fashioned way.

* Complete POD for all CGI::WPM::* modules; they are missing Synopsis,
Description, and method lists or descriptions.  Until then, you'll just have to
look at the code or my examples to know what to call, sorry.

* Add a CGI::WPM::Password module to implement simple password protection for
some/all of a generated website.

* Add a CGI::WPM::MessageBoard module to implement a threaded discussion board.
