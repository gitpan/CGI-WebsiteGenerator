2000-12-26   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 0.3201.
	
	* Removed the ".txt" extensions from my ReadMe files, since they aren't 
	pulled out by the CPAN documentation system otherwise.
	
2000-12-26   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 0.32.
	
	* Added complete Synopsis POD to all the modules, as well as a few notes in 
	the Description, and also added modules to See Also.  All modules have been 
	increased in version to 0.32.  For most modules there were no code changes.  
	But there should now be enough help that you can actually start *using* 
	these things.  I deeply regret not having this documentation earlier.  The 
	ReadMe file also has a copy of the Synopsis from CGI::WPM::Globals.
		
	* The other main purpose of this release is to ensure compatability with 
	the mod_perl environment in addition to the CGI environment.  This means 
	that I have tested all of the modules in a production mod_perl environment 
	(my web sites) and found that they function properly within the demands that 
	I place on them.  Previously my only test environment was CGI.
	
	* Updated CGI::WPM::Globals to stay compatible with changes to the 
	CGI::FormMaker 0.92 distribution.  It's own public interface is unchanged.

	* Added many new features to CGI::WPM::Usage, mostly in the areas of 
	customizability, and therefore the public interface is completely different.  
	Among the changes: 
	- A poor design feature that allowed Usage to take the preferences for other 
	  WPM modules and call them in turn, such as how MultiPage does, no longer 
	  exists.  Your main program should instead call the other WPM modules and 
	  then Usage afterwards, with the same Globals object.
	- You can now choose which subset of transaction details should be tracked, 
	  rather than being forced to use all-or-none as before.
	- You can now choose which subset of transaction details that are logged 
	  should be e-mailed to you on a max-daily basis.  In addition, the 
	  information can be divided into multiple e-mails instead of all-in-one.  
	  This also means that you can keep count logs without any e-mails at all.
	  Log files in each mail group can optionally be cleared each day or not.
	- Other, smaller customizations, particularly with referrer categorizing.
	
	* I removed the demo website, which was horribly out of date.  One such as 
	it will return later.
	
	* The "Manifest" was reformatted to be more machine friendly.
	
2000-11-14   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 0.31.

	* This release is mostly a compatability update to ensure that it works with 
	the public interface changes in the CGI-FormMaker 0.91 distribution.  The 
	most significant updates in this regard are to the CGI::WPM::Globals class, 
	which is now functionally synchrononized with the CGI-FormMaker classes in 
	respect to the methods new(), initialize(), and clone().
	
	* Updated CGI::WPM::Globals to change the way it deals with instances where
	you want to make several CGI::WPM::Globals objects rather than the usual of 
	one.  If you want more than one Globals object, you need to use the clone() 
	method of the first one to make others, as more than one new() could hang 
	(block on read) your program.  See the ChangeLog in the CGI-FormMaker 
	distribution for more details, as the relevant behaviour and constraints 
	come from CGI::WPM::Globals being a subclass of CGI::WebUserInput.  This 
	class is now at version 0.31 up from 0.3.

	* Updated CGI::WPM::Base to rename the function finalize_page_content() to 
	finalize() and to add a new function execute().  A depreciated shim method 
	with the older name of finalize() is provided so that programs which use it 
	won't break with this distribution upgrade.  For your convenience, the new 
	method execute( $globals ) has the same effect as calling the 3 methods 
	[new( $globals ), dispatch_by_user(), finalize()] in that order.  In fact, 
	using this is recommended considering that subclasses of CGI::WPM::Base are 
	conceptually applications anyway (but embeddable in other programs).  This 
	class is now at version 0.31 up from 0.3.

	* Minor updates to CGI::WPM::Multipage and CGI::WPM::Usage whereby they use 
	the renamed finalize() method of Base when calling subordinate classes.  
	Also, CGI::WPM::Usage recognizes a few more urls as being search engines.
	Both classes are now at version 0.3001 up from 0.3.

2000-09-04   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 0.3.

	* This release contains the following modules, which were previously the 
	high-level components of my "libdwg" distribution, but I have set the 
	lower-level components off on their own for those of you who only want to use
	them and not these modules:
		CGI::WPM::Globals 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Base 0.3
		CGI::WPM::MultiPage 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Static 0.3
		CGI::WPM::MailForm 0.3
		CGI::WPM::GuestBook 0.3
		CGI::WPM::SegTextDoc 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Redirect 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Usage 0.3
			
	* These modules contain incomplete POD within them.  They do have Name, 
	Requirements, Syntax, and lists of methods and "preferences".  They are 
	lacking Synopsis, Description, and descriptions for the methods and prefs.
	
	* These modules requires Perl version 5.004.
	
	* The following distributions are needed by this one.  Some in all 
	circumstances and some optionally depending on how your web site is 
	configured.  Only directly-referenced modules are considered.  Other 
	distributions that these call in turn are not listed:
		- CGI-FormGenerator-0.9.tar.gz
		- libnet-1.0703.tar.gz
		- EventCountFile-1.0.tar.gz
	
2000-08-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* libdwg 1.11, the last version of the distribution to include the above 
	modules, was released.
	
2000-07-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* libdwg 1.0, the first version of any distribution to include the above 
	modules, was released on CPAN.

2000-05-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Completed primary development on these modules' code, but the POD is mostly
non-existant.

2000-04-14   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the final versions of these modules.
	
	* All modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

1999-07 thru 1999-12

	* Worked on second prototype of code that ended up in these modules.  The 
	effects of this development, as far as CGI-WebsiteGenerator's own modules are 
	concerned, were mostly confined to Globals.

	* As a separate but parallel project, I also implemented a complete and
generic Threaded Discussion Board object using some of my low level modules *and*
CGI.pm.  This board is possibly still in use today in a corporate Intranet site.

1999-02 thru 1999-05

	* Created first prototypes of code that ended up in these modules and used 
	them to generate my web sites for a year.  Many present-day features were 
	present at that time, including static pages, segmented text pages, e-mail 
	forms and guest books with unlimited questions (but were text only), 
	redirection, and usage tracking.  The implementation was 
	just a hell of a lot uglier.  These modules also used CGI.pm to do the 
	things that I now use my CGI-FormGenerator distribution to do instead.
