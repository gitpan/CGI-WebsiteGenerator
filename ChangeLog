	* Release 0.3.

	* This release contains the following modules, which were previously the 
	high-level components of my "libdwg" distribution, but I have set the 
	lower-level components off on their own for those of you who only want to use
	them and not these modules:
		CGI::WPM::Globals 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Base 0.3
		CGI::WPM::MultiPage 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Static 0.3
		CGI::WPM::MailForm 0.3
		CGI::WPM::GuestBook 0.3
		CGI::WPM::SegTextDoc 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Redirect 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Usage 0.3
			
	* These modules contain incomplete POD within them.  They do have Name, 
	Requirements, Syntax, and lists of methods and "preferences".  They are 
	lacking Synopsis, Description, and descriptions for the methods and prefs.
	
	* These modules requires Perl version 5.004.
	
	* The following distributions are needed by this one.  Some in all 
	circumstances and some optionally depending on how your web site is 
	configured.  Only directly-referenced modules are considered.  Other 
	distributions that these call in turn are not listed:
		- CGI-FormGenerator-0.9.tar.gz
		- libnet-1.0703.tar.gz
		- EventCountFile-1.0.tar.gz

	* Completed primary development on these modules' code, but the POD is mostly
non-existant.

	* Began development on the final versions of these modules.
	
	* All modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

1999-07 thru 1999-12

	* Worked on second prototype of code that ended up in these modules.  The 
	effects of this development, as far as CGI-WebsiteGenerator's own modules are 
	concerned, were mostly confined to Globals.

	* As a separate but parallel project, I also implemented a complete and
generic Threaded Discussion Board object using some of my low level modules *and*
CGI.pm.  This board is possibly still in use today in a corporate Intranet site.

1999-02 thru 1999-05

	* Created first prototypes of code that ended up in these modules and used 
	them to generate my web sites for a year.  Many present-day features were 
	present at that time, including static pages, segmented text pages, e-mail 
	forms and guest books with unlimited questions (but were text only), 
	redirection, and usage tracking.  The implementation was 
	just a hell of a lot uglier.  These modules also used CGI.pm to do the 
	things that I now use my CGI-FormGenerator distribution to do instead.
