                     DYNAMIC WEBSITE GENERATOR
----------------------------------------------------------------------

by Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

This distribution has been renamed to "duncand-prerelease" from
"CGI-WebsiteGenerator" because the old name really isn't that appropriate.
Largely this is because the modules are not properly documented and it is very
difficult for new people to use them because of it.  The new name reflects that
fact that what people see here is in-development product, and while this product
does function, it is subject to change a lot and is poorly documented.

The only reason that this file and its enclosing distribution exists is to blot
out as much as possible the details of what this distribution was, due to the
fact that listings are never deleted from search.cpan.org, but can only be
covered up by newer versions.  If it is possible to delete distributions from the
listings, then this document will no longer be necessary.
